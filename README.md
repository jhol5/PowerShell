# Powershell-Stuff

## Folder Structure

* Functions
    * Folders for functions with readme.md files.
* Modules
    * Folders for PowerShell modules with readme.md files.
* Scripts
    * These PowerShell Scripts don't have any input functionality like functions do. They may have an output like function, though. Subfolders should be used if there is a group of scripts that have a similar purpose.
